AssignmentProblems reads data files in `gap` format for Generalized Assignmnent Problem (GAP) instances.

## Usage

The main type used by the package is `AssignmentProblem`, defined as follows:

```julia
struct AssignmentProblem
    name::String                # Instance name

    capacities::Vector{Int64}   # Agents' capacities
    costs::Matrix{Int64}        # Assigments costs (agents x jobs)
    consumptions::Matrix{Int64} # Assigments consumptions (agents x jobs)

    lb::Int64                   # Lower bound (typemin(Int64) if not known)
    ub::Int64                   # Upper bound (typemax(Int64) if not known)
end
```

The package also defines the functions `na` and `nj` returning the number of agents and jobs, respectively.

Some classical GAP instances from the literature are preloaded. For example, to load GAP instance `a05100`:

```julia
data = loadAssignmentProblem(:a05100)
```

There is a second optional parameter to set the objective function used (default `:Min` or `:Max`). This is only used to populate lb and ub fields.

See the [full instance list](https://github.com/rafaelmartinelli/AssignmentProblems.jl/tree/main/data).

AssignmentProblems also loads custom GAP instances (following [ORLib format](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/gapinfo.html)):

```julia
data = loadAssignmentProblem("/path/to/your/GAP/instance.txt")
```

## Installation

AssignmentProblems is *not* yet a registered Julia Package.
You can install AssignmentProblems through the Julia package manager.
Open Julia's interactive session (REPL) and type:

```julia
] add https://github.com/rafaelmartinelli/AssignmentProblems.jl
```
